            <p class="tracking-wide text-center overflow-ellipsis font-big">Founded in 1998, Freeside is the student run and managed Linux Cluster at the University of Hull filling a need for students to gain hands on Linux experience in a collaborative production environment where experimentation is encouraged and breaking systems is a learning experience, not a crisis. Freeside is also the long running computer science related student group on Campus with a history spanning nearly 25 years.</p>

            <p class="tracking-wide text-center overflow-ellipsis font-big font-semibold">
                Freeside retains a lab in Robert Blackburn which students can access by going to RBB-300. Several Linux based machines are available for use and we actively encourage students and members to use the lab for projects, collaboration and learning. A university ID card is required for access to the lab and it is off limits to the wider public.
            </p>

            <p class="tracking-wide text-center overflow-ellipsis font-big">Whilst not mandatory, students can become a member of Freeside. There are many benefits of doing so including gaining knowledge and experience (e.g. system administration / coding experience), networking and career opportunities, social events / weekly virtual meet ups and access to the Freeside lab. Of course, the best benefit is that Freeside is completely free to join!</p>
